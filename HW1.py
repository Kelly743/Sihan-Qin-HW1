# coding: utf-8

# #### 1. Pick one of the datasets from the ChatBot session(s) of the **TUT demo** (or from your own ChatBot session if you wish) and use the code produced through the ChatBot interactions to import the data and confirm that the dataset has missing values<br>
# 

# In[1]:


import pandas as pd
url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2020/2020-05-05/villagers.csv"
df = pd.read_csv(url)
df.isna().sum()


# 2. Start a new ChatBot session with an initial prompt introducing the dataset you're using and request help to determine how many columns and rows of data a pandas DataFrame has, and then
#   1.use code provided in your ChatBot session to print out the number of rows and columns of the dataset; and,
#   2.write your own general definitions of the meaning of "observations" and "variables" based on asking the ChatBot to explain these terms in the context of your dataset

# In[2]:


df.shape


# Observation is the single data entries in row of my dataset. Variables are the attributes or characteristic entries in column of my dataset 

# 3. Ask the ChatBot how you can provide simple summaries of the columns in the dataset and use the suggested code to provide these summaries for your dataset

# In[4]:


df.describe()


# In[9]:


df['birthday'].value_counts()


# #### 4. If the dataset you're using has (a) non-numeric variables and (b) missing values in numeric variables, explain (perhaps using help from a ChatBot if needed) the discrepancies between size of the dataset given by `df.shape` and what is reported by `df.describe()` with respect to (a) the number of columns it analyzes and (b) the values it reports in the "count" column<br>

# df.shape is for compute the size of the dataset such as how many columnsa and rows. df.describe() will dignorethe missing value, I cannot use df.describe() to see the entire data because I cannot see the missing value and non-numerical column. In the count column, df.shape shows the total number of rows and df.describe() show the column that have on missing value.

# #### 5. Use your ChatBot session to help understand the difference between the following and then provide your own paraphrasing summarization of that difference

# Attibutes are used to describe object's characteristics and methods are functions of the object

# #### 6. The `df.describe()` method provides the 'count', 'mean', 'std', 'min', '25%', '50%', '75%', and 'max' summary statistics for each variable it analyzes. Give the definitions (perhaps using help from the ChatBot if needed) of each of these summary statistics<br>

# count: The amount of the column that are does not have empty entries
# mean: The value of all the entries in column in average
# std: Can measure the changes or dispersion of the entries in column
# min:The smallest value of entries in column
# 25%: A value that 25% of the values are smaller to this
# 50%: The median value of the data from smallest to largest
# 75%: A value that 75% of the values are smaller to this
# max: The largest value of entries in column

# #### 7. Missing data can be considered "across rows" or "down columns".  Consider how `df.dropna()` or `del df['col']` should be applied to most efficiently use the available non-missing data in your dataset and briefly answer the following questions in your own words

# 1. Provide an example of a "use case" in which using `df.dropna()` might be peferred over using `del df['col']`<br><br>
#     
#     

# An example of using df.dropna() is better when the dataframe has data of many people with their informations and entries in column have massing values.

# 2. Provide an example of "the opposite use case" in which using `del df['col']` might be preferred over using `df.dropna()` <br><br>

# When the dataframe has many column and for some column have not necessary entries del df['col'] is better to use for remove the column to simplify the data 

# 3. Discuss why applying `del df['col']` before `df.dropna()` when both are used together could be important<br><br>

# As del df['col'] is for simplify dataframe so first when the dataset has many column, clean the un-necessary column that contain empty value can help to focus on important data, in addition by reomove column I don't needed can avoid extra computaion. Overall can improve my data quality. 

# 4. Remove all missing data from one of the datasets you're considering using some combination of `del df['col']` and/or `df.dropna()` and give a justification for your approach, including a "before and after" report of the results of your approach for your dataset.<br><br>

# Here are befor and after report, and the meaning of using del dl['col'] and df.dropna() are simplify the dataframe to make it more efficiency and quality by remove irrelevant column focuse on the column that relavant to my research.

# #### 8. Give brief explanations in your own words for any requested answers to the questions below

# 1. Use your ChatBot session to understand what `df.groupby("col1")["col2"].describe()` does and then demonstrate and explain this using a different example from the "titanic" data set other than what the ChatBot automatically provide for you

# df.groupby("col1") is grouping the dataframe in column 11 by special value
# ["col2"] compute the staatistic summary of column 12
# describe() compute the count,mean,std,min,25%,50%,75%,max of selected column  

# 2. Assuming you've not yet removed missing values in the manner of question "7" above, `df.describe()` would have different values in the `count` value for different data columns depending on the missingness present in the original data.  Why do these capture something fundamentally different from the values in the `count` that result from doing something like `df.groupby("col1")["col2"].describe()`?

# df.scribe is for overview for all columns, it doesnot arrange them in groups or categories. df.groupby("col1")["col2"].describe() is for specific statistic of column2

# 3. Intentionally introduce the following errors into your code and report your opinion as to whether it's easier to (a) work in a ChatBot session to fix the errors, or (b) use google to search for and fix errors: first share the errors you get in the ChatBot session and see if you can work with ChatBot to troubleshoot and fix the coding errors, and then see if you think a google search for the error provides the necessary toubleshooting help more quickly than ChatGPT<br><br>

# 1. Forget to include `import pandas as pd` in your code 

# import pandas as pd
# For this question I need to add this code at the very beginning of the code and run to invoid this error

# 2. Mistype "titanic.csv" as "titanics.csv"

# titanic.csv
# I need to correct my code and update

#  3. Try to use a dataframe before it's been assigned into the variable

# filename = 'titanic.csv'
# First check I correctly created the datafrome before I use it and ensure it is defined

#  4. Forget one of the parentheses somewhere the code

# if (5 > 3):
# I need to check the syntax error and review my code also do testing for my code to fix this error

# 5. Mistype one of the names of the chained functions with the code

# In this case I need to identify the error message, check the names and correct it 

# 6. Use a column name that's not in your data for the `groupby` and column selection 

# First I need to verify my column name is exist in my dataframe and then replace the incorrect name to aviriable name of my dataframe

# 7. Forget to put the column name as a string in quotes for the `groupby` and column selection, and see if the ChatBot and google are still as helpful as they were for the previous question

# I need to check the error message verrify the correct syntax and then fix it

# Chatgpt is more helpful because in chatgpt I can directly enter the error message, or the question of the problem, no matter what form chatgpt can understand and accurately give the answer; and then there is a followup if I can continue to ask, chatgpt will remember our previous chat records, but google can notã€‚

Summary of Our Conversation
Introduction to Data Handling:
We discussed how to check for missing values in a dataset using pandas in Python.
You learned about the distinction between attributes (e.g., df.shape) and methods (e.g., df.describe()) in pandas.
Summary Statistics Explained:
Definitions of summary statistics provided by df.describe(), including count, mean, standard deviation, minimum, percentiles (25%, 50%, 75%), and maximum.
Use Cases:
df.dropna(): Best for removing rows with missing values, ensuring complete data for analysis.
del df['col']: Best for removing entire columns that are irrelevant or not needed for the analysis.
Combining del and dropna:
It was explained that removing irrelevant columns first (del df['col']) simplifies the DataFrame and improves the efficiency of the df.dropna() operation, which handles missing values in relevant columns.
Example Demonstrations:
We demonstrated how to use del df['col'] and df.dropna() with a sample dataset to clean up missing data.
Code Results
Initial Dataset:
import pandas as pd

# Sample DataFrame with missing values
data = {
    'Name': ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie', 'David'],
    'Age': [25, None, 30, 22],
    'City': ['New York', 'Los Angeles', None, 'Chicago'],
    'Irrelevant_Column': ['X', 'Y', 'Z', 'W']
}

df = pd.DataFrame(data)
print("Original DataFrame:")
print(df)
output:
Original DataFrame:
      Name   Age         City Irrelevant_Column
0    Alice  25.0     New York                X
1      Bob   NaN  Los Angeles                Y
2  Charlie  30.0         None                Z
3    David  22.0      Chicago                W
code for cleaning
# Step 1: Remove the irrelevant column
del df['Irrelevant_Column']

# Step 2: Drop rows with missing values in the remaining columns
cleaned_df = df.dropna()

print("\nCleaned DataFrame:")
print(cleaned_df)
output
Cleaned DataFrame:
      Name   Age      City
0    Alice  25.0  New York
3    David  22.0  Chicago
Summary
Purpose: We aimed to remove missing data from the dataset using a combination of column deletion and row removal techniques.
Approach:
Removed irrelevant columns using del.
Removed rows with missing values using df.dropna().
Outcome: The final cleaned dataset contains only complete rows in the relevant columns, making it suitable for further analysis.
This approach ensures that the dataset is both relevant and complete, enhancing the reliability and quality of any subsequent analysis or modeling.
